# An async redux demo

This is an extension of the react/ redux starter.

It's a minimal setup which shows how one might do async redux with thunk.


Exercise :

- read the docs : http://redux.js.org/docs/advanced/AsyncActions.html
- clone this repo and have a look around it, nothing things you're not sure about
- add another async action of your own (an API call, or a `fs.readFile`)
- add an action to track the progress of an async action, and display that state to users
